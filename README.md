I got the idea for this thingy when I was doing the JavaScript 30 tutorials by Wes Bos that shows you how to make a 'JavaScript Drum Kit'. I noticed there was a lacking of a cowbell sound. Then I got a fever and, for some reason, I knew the remedy for this fever was ever increasing amounts of cowbell. So I took what I learn learned from the above tutorial (which you can find [here](https://youtu.be/VuN8qwZoego)) and created something to give me the necessary amount of cowbell I needed.

I'm hoping to make it more responsive by adding features that would allow one to play with the cowbells using a touch screen and not just a keyboard (which you're restricted to now). Also, making a background that looks good at any size would be nice as well.
